# Scala Interview Utils

This repository is a nice place to maintain the types of questions I like to ask when interviewing for Scala developers. I don't ask all these questions, and usually I just use these as a starting point and expand. That way, even if someone has been informed by their agent in advance what questions previous candidates were asked, it won't help them.

* If you were forced to use Java, but could take any feature from Scala you wanted, what would it be. (Assume Java 8 to avoid everyone saying first class functions). Related: What is your favourite feature of Scala.

* What would you change in Scala if you could.
