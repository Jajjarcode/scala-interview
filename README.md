# scala-interview

This repository is a nice place to maintain the types of questions I like to ask when interviewing for Scala developers. I don't ask all these questions, and usually I just use these as a starting point and expand. That way, even if someone has been informed by their agent in advance what questions previous candidates were asked, it won't help them.
